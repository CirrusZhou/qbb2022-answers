Excellent work, and thank you for the excellent commends in your REAMDE! Really great results from the advanced problems as well!

Good use of `tr  " " "\t"` in exercise 3. An alternate way of doing this would just be to modify the awk script to output a tab-delimited file using `{OFS='\t'}` (this sets the Output Field Separator). But tr is just as good!
